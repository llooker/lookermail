		Things to keep in mind when performing analysis on these numbers: <br/>
		<ul>
        <li>These numbers are produced from the reporting database and should be current if your clients have recorded their time in the system of record.</li>
        <li>The comparison to previous periods is based on the relative completion of the period, i.e. if today is the 20th, the first 20 days of last month vs 20 days of this month</li>
		</ul>
